# jax-bootstrap
JAX custom Bootstrap 4 theme

## Quick Start
1. Replace the bootstrap.min.css file in your project with jax-bootstrap.min.css
2. Below any existing bootstrap javascript in your project, add jax-bootstrap.min.js 

## This is an extremely early/alpha version of this theme
Much (meaning just about everything) is left to do, so please return often for updates

Note: The free version of the DIN font is used in this theme. If you are hosting your JAX website on a jax.org domain or subdomain, please **contact me** and I will help you set up the theme with our licensed DIN web font.
